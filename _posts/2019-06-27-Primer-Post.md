# Introducci√≥n
Many companies would like to have an application to send whatsapp messages since its the messaging service par excellence and almost everyone uses it, so they would reach more people.
Today I come to introduce you a small script made in java that allows you to send a whatsapp message to a client through a phone line without the need to connect to whatsapp.

First, everybody have a whatsapp ID. the whatsapp ID is our telephone number with the prefix of the country.

```java
int x=1;
int y=2;
int suma=x+y;
```
